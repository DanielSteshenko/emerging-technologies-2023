# Emerging Technologies 2023

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks: one focused on Deutsch's Algorithm, including its implementation using Qiskit, and another compiling tasks distributed throughout the semester.


## Overview

- [Tasks:](https://github.com/DanielSteshenko/emerging-technologies-2023/blob/main/tasks.ipynb) This notebook contains tasks that were distributed throughout the semester.  <br>
- [Project on Duetch's Algorithm:](https://github.com/DanielSteshenko/emerging-technologies-2023/blob/main/project.ipynb) Within this notebook, I delve into Deutsch's Algorithm, the problem it addresses, its Qiskit implementation, and a comparative analysis between quantum and classical computing.

## Prerequisites

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
2. [Python 3.x & Pip](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or Any IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
4. [Qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run this repository on your machine:

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DanielSteshenko/emerging-technologies-2023.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the cloned directory:**
    ```bash
    cd emerging-technologies-2023
    ```

3. **Install Qiskit:**
    ```bash
    pip install qiskit
    ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

This will automatically open the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your default web browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). From there, you can explore and run the notebooks.

### Using Visual Studio Code

If you prefer Visual Studio Code, follow these additional steps:

1. **Install the Python and Jupyter extension for Visual Studio Code:**
    - [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) & [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

2. **Open the cloned directory in Visual Studio Code:**
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

3. **Install Qiskit in Visual Studio Code terminal:**
    ```bash
    pip install qiskit
    ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook using Visual Studio Code:**
    - Open the notebook files (`tasks.ipynb` and `project.ipynb`) in Visual Studio Code.
    - Use the Jupyter extension to run the notebooks.
